      GDAADemo has only 2 functions:\n\n

      1/ UPLOAD (upload icon) will invoke a camera and the resulting picture is uploaded to
      Google Drive, creating a simple tree directory structure in the process.
      The createTreeGDAA/createTreeREST methods allow to test different methods
      (search, create folder, ...) in the process.\n\n

      2/ DOWNLOAD (download icon) scans the tree created by GDAADemo
      (testTreeGDAA/testTreeREST methods). If the object is a file (jpg), it\'s metadata
      is updated (description field) and the content is downloaded (and dumped)
      - only the number of bytes is reported. \n\n

      It should be noted, that the code uses the simplest implementation, the \'AWAIT\' flavor
      of the GDAA calls. It must be implemented in non-UI thread, but the code is simpler,
      best suited for testing. This also allows me to keep GDAA methods compatible with
      the REST counterparts.
